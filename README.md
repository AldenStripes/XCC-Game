# XCC-Game
This repository contains all the code in all the various scripts I have for my school game jam game. 
When I work on the game, I will create a folder for that day and put the scripts I made that day into the folder.
If I work on a day and I don't make any changes to previous scripts, I won't paste the script a second time.
However if I do make changes to previous scripts, I will paste the updated version the same day, and make a note in previous versions that it has been updated.

At the end of the game jam, I will put all of my scripts into one big folder for easy access. Enjoy!
