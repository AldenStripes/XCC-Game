# XCC-Game
This repository contains all the code in all the various scripts I have for my school game jam game. 
When I work on the game, I will create a folder for that day and put the scripts I made that day into the folder.
If I work on a day and I don't make any changes to previous scripts, I won't paste the script a second time.
That means all the scripts you see at the end of the game jam will be unique and all the ones I have for my game.
